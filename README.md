# Data-Analysis-with-Python-Projects
This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects assigned by FreeCodeCamp in their Data Analysis with Python course. 

1. [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator:](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Projects/tree/main/Project%201%3A%20Mean-Variance-Standard%20Deviation%20Calculator) This project uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

2. [Demographic Data Analyzer:](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Projects/tree/main/Project%202%3A%20Demographic%20Data%20Analyzer) This project analyzes demographic data using Pandas using a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

3. [Medical Data Visualizer:](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Projects/tree/main/Project%203:%20Medical%20Data%20Visualizer) This project visualizes and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

4. [Page View Time Series Visualizer: ](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Projects/tree/main/Project%204%3A%20Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer) This project visualizes time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. 

5. [Sea Level Predictor:](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Projects/tree/main/Project%205:%20Sea%20Level%20Predictor) This project analyzes a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
